# Introduction
This project comprises two applications: QT_Drivers App, designed for drivers, and QT_Passengers App, tailored for passengers. The primary objective is to foster transparency between drivers and riders, providing passengers with a curated list of available drivers along with their respective prices for a given destination. This empowers passengers to make informed decisions based on their preferences and convenience.

# QT_Passengers App
This application is designed for passengers to select their preferred drivers based on their individual preferences and convenience. Passengers can view a comprehensive list of available drivers, including details such as pricing, seating capacity, and estimated travel time for their desired destination. Armed with this information, passengers can make well-informed decisions that align with their needs.
After the trip, passengers are prompted to provide mandatory feedback to the driver, ensuring accountability and maintaining service quality standards.
